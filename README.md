A set of tools for working with the fish fingers (FF) bytecode script format used in the mainline LittleBigPlanet franchise.

Documentation is TODO

## Special Thanks

*Massive* shoutouts to [Aidan](https://github.com/ennuo) for the constant help with my reverse engineering efforts, this project would not have been possible if it not for the work they did on [toolkit](https://github.com/ennuo/toolkit) (which I referenced for resource serialization) and craftworld.js (which I referenced for the FF file structure and instruction class types).

Along with shoutouts to [uh wot](https://github.com/uhwot) for early help with the bytecode encoding, and pointing me towards craftworld.js for the file structure.
